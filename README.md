Sudoku
========

Simple Sudoku game built with Tkinter.

About
-----

This is a very simple version of this game. It has only one level, which is quite easy to solve. But the solution checker can work for any solution. So basically you can enter numbers without clicking the start button and if its correct, then program will successfully check it. 

Solution checker works this way: First it takes numbers from entries, sorts them into the lists and starts the checking algorithm. This algorithm is quite simple, first it checks whether or not are there duplicate numbers in horizontal lines, then in vertical and finally in 3x3 boxes. 

Feel free to add anything you would like to this program which may include: save/load function, difficulty selection function, level generation function and etc.
